# Overview

We propose to use the physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the scattered form of acoustic isotropic and anisotropic wave equations

PINN reduces the computational cost by avoid computing the inverse of the impedance matrix, which is suitable for anisotropic large models 

The resulting scattered wavefields are free of numerical dispersion artifacts
